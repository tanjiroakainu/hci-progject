        <h2>Illinois Legislature</h2>
        <p>Lincoln's political career began when he was elected to the Illinois state legislature as a member of the Whig Party in 1834. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives.</p>
        
        <h2>U.S. House of Representatives</h2>
        <p>In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served one two-year term. During his time in Congress, he opposed the Mexican-American War and proposed the "Spot Resolutions," which questioned President Polk's claims about the start of the war.</p>
        
        <h2>Lincoln-Douglas Debates</h2>
        <p>In 1858, Lincoln ran for the U.S. Senate against Stephen A. Douglas. The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates took place during this campaign, with slavery being the primary topic. Although Lincoln lost the election, these debates elevated his national profile.</p>
        
        <h2>Republican Nomination and Presidential Election</h2>
        <p>In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party nomination for president. He went on to win the presidential election, defeating three other candidates in a divided nation. His victory without a single electoral vote from the South triggered the secession crisis.</p>
