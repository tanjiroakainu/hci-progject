        <h2>Birth and Childhood</h2>
        <p>Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a one-room log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky. He was the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln.</p>
        
        <p>In 1816, the family moved to Indiana, partly due to land disputes and partly to escape the institution of slavery which existed in Kentucky. Lincoln's mother died when he was just nine years old from milk sickness.</p>
        
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Lincoln's formal education was limited to approximately 18 months of schooling, but he was largely self-educated, reading whatever books he could get his hands on. He developed a love for reading and became known for his self-taught knowledge.</p>
        
        <h2>Early Career</h2>
        <p>In 1830, the family moved to Illinois. As a young man, Lincoln worked various jobs including a shopkeeper, postmaster, and surveyor. He eventually taught himself law and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1836.</p>
