        <h2>Evolution of Lincoln's Views on Slavery</h2>
        <p>While Lincoln had always personally opposed slavery, his public position evolved over time. Prior to his presidency, he advocated preventing the spread of slavery rather than abolishing it where it already existed.</p>
        
        <h2>Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation</h2>
        <p>Following the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, Lincoln issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. This document gave the Confederate states 100 days to return to the Union or have their slaves declared free.</p>
        
        <h2>The Emancipation Proclamation</h2>
        <p>On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared "that all persons held as slaves" within the rebellious states "are, and henceforward shall be free." While the proclamation did not immediately free all slaves (it only applied to states in rebellion), it fundamentally transformed the character of the war and made the abolition of slavery an explicit Union war aim.</p>
        
        <h2>The 13th Amendment</h2>
        <p>Recognizing the legal limitations of the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln worked to ensure a permanent end to slavery through constitutional means. He pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery throughout the United States. The amendment was passed by Congress in January 1865 and ratified by the states in December 1865, after Lincoln's death.</p>
