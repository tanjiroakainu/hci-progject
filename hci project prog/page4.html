        <h2>Inauguration and Cabinet</h2>
        <p>Lincoln was inaugurated as the 16th President of the United States on March 4, 1861. In his first inaugural address, he attempted to reassure the South that he had no intention of abolishing slavery where it already existed.</p>
        
        <p>Lincoln assembled a "team of rivals" for his cabinet, including several of his former political opponents such as William H. Seward as Secretary of State and Salmon P. Chase as Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
        
        <h2>Domestic Policy</h2>
        <p>Despite the war, Lincoln oversaw significant domestic achievements, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Signing the Homestead Act of 1862, which provided government land to small farmers</li>
            <li>Establishing land-grant colleges through the Morrill Act</li>
            <li>Creating a national banking system</li>
            <li>Initiating the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Re-election of 1864</h2>
        <p>In 1864, Lincoln ran for re-election on the National Union Party ticket with Democrat Andrew Johnson as his running mate. Despite early predictions that he would lose, military victories helped secure his re-election over Democratic candidate George B. McClellan.</p>
